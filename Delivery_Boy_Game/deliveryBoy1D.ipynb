    "\n",
    "This game is about a <b>delivery boy</b>, riding a bike, who has got a job to <b>deliver</b> a <b>parcel</b> to it's intended <b>receiver</b>. This is a 1-dimensional game where the length of the world has been set to 50 and the delivery boy has to deliver the parcel in atmost 50 steps. On his way, he will encounter various <b>percepts</b>(the percepts have been located randomly in the world) like <b>Gas Station</b>, <b>Food Court</b>, <b>Helmet</b>, etc. Based on the given percept, the agent will perform a respective action. For e.g. If the delivery boy <b>percepts</b> <b>Food</b> court, he will <b>eat</b> food. Also, if the agent(delivery boy) refuels his bike, he will get 25 steps extra to ride his bike in the world. This increases the chance for the agent(delivery boy) to deliver the parcel.\n",

For instance, if the agent percepts a helmet on his way to delivery, he will pick up the helmet and wear it. While, wearing the helmet, if the agent perceives a pit, he won't slow down his bike(unlike in the case of 1-D world). Instead, he will ride through the pit at his normal speed and will hence break his helmet. Also, if the agent(delivery boy) refuels his bike, he will get 250 steps extra to ride his bike in the world. This increases the chance for agent(delivery boy) to deliver the parcel.\n",
